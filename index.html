			<h2>Motorsport üèéÔ∏è</h2>
			<p>
				When you think of me, the first word that comes to mind is motorsport. My passion for this thrilling sport ignited when I was just nine years old, watching an F1 race in Melbourne. The roar of the engines, the exhilarating speed, and the breathtaking overtakes left me mesmerized.
			</p>
			<p>
				That was the day I discovered my love for a sport that would change my life forever. Today, I am fortunate enough to be a professional karting driver, living my dream and traveling the world doing what I love most. Over the years, I have achieved numerous victories, including the French Championship in 2021, and participated in some of the most prestigious races in the world, such as the Super Nationals in Las Vegas and the World Championship in Le Mans.

				If you're interested in learning more about my sport, I invite you to take a lap with me around the Castelletto Circuit during the European Championship.

			<h2>Rugby üèâ</h2>
			<p>
				I've been passionate about rugby since I was five years old and when I had the chance to watch a game between Lyon and Toulon for the first time. The raw energy and physicality of the sport got me, and from that point, it has been a big part of my life.
			</p>
			<p>
				I started playing rugby at the age of 7 and continued for the next six years in France and Australia. I loved every moment on the field, whether it was scoring a try or tackling an opponent. Being part of multiple teams was very special, and I made friendships on the pitch that will last a lifetime.
			</p>
			<p>
				Even now, years later, rugby remains a significant part of my life. I still get that adrenaline rush every time I watch a game. And going to the stadium on Saturday afternoons to support my home team is always one of the best moments of the week.

			<h2>Traveling üèùÔ∏è</h2>
			<p>
				Ever since I moved to Australia at the age of 10, my passion for traveling has been unstoppable. I was lucky enough to have the opportunity to visit all of Australia, from the beautiful beaches of the Gold Coast to the breathtaking landscapes of the outback.
			</p>
			<p>
				One of my favorite places was Kangaroo Island, where I got to see kangaroos, wallabies, and koalas up close. But my most memorable experience was snorkeling in the Great Barrier Reef, surrounded by colorful fish and coral.
			</p>
			<p>
				Traveling to other countries only fueled my wanderlust even more. New Zealand's stunning natural scenery took my breath away, while French Polynesia's crystal-clear waters were a sight to behold. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Each trip I take leaves me with unforgettable memories and a desire to see more of the world.
